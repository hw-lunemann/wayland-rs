# CHANGELOG: wayland-client

## Unreleased

- Introduce `EventQueue::poll_dispatch_pending` for running dispatch using an async runtime.

## 0.30.0-beta.1

#### Breaking changes

- Large rework of the API as a consequence of the rework of the backend.

## 0.30.0-alpha10

- Introduce conversion methods between `wayland_backend::Handle` and `ConnectionHandle`

## 0.30.0-alpha2

#### Breaking changes

- The `DelegateDispatch` mechanism is changed around an explicit trait-base extraction of module
  state from the main app state.

## 0.30.0-alpha1

Full rework of the crate, which is now organized around a trait-based `Dispatch` metchanism.

This can effectively be considered a new crate altogether.
